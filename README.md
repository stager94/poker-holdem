Hold’em Poker

Task(complexity grows from min to max through the list):
написать структуру классов и методов без реализации(спроектировать программу)
написать программу в псевдокоде
написать реальный код
написать тесты(TDD)
Flow
It’s necessary to implement Hold‘em poker simulator. One game round consists of following steps:
initialize deck
deal 2 cards to each player (pre-flop)
put 3 cards on the table (flop)
put 1 more card on the table (turn)
put 1 more card on the table (river)
determine winner
Each player constructs 5-card combination (hand) using 2 cards in his (her) hand and 5 cards on the table. Player who has best 5-card combination wins.
Deck
Standard 52 cards deck.
Card faces: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 T J Q K A
Card suits: H S C D
Cards:    2H - two of hearts
    KD - jack of diamonds
    QC - queen of clubs
Hand types
From lowest to highest:
High card    2H 3C 6D 9S JS
One pair    2H 3C 6D JD JS
Two pair    2H 3C 3D JD JS
Three of a kind    2H 7D JC JD JS
Straight    2H 3D 4C 5S 6D
Flush    2H 5H 9H JH AH
Full house    7H 7D JC JD JS
Four of a kind    7H JH JC JD JS
Straight flush    9H TH JH QH KH
Additional comparisons
High    2H 3C 6D 9S JS    >    2H 3C 6D 7S JS
Pair    2H 3C 6D JD JS    >    2H 3C 5D JD JS
Two pair    2H 3C 3D JD JS    >    2H 9C 9D TD TS
    3H 9C 9D TD TS    >    2H 9C 9D TD TS
Three of a kind    3H 7D JC JD JS    >    2H 7D JC JD JS
Straight    2H 3D 4C 5S 6D    >    AC 2H 3D 4C 5S
    (AC 2H 3D 4C 5S is also Straight)
Flush    2H 5H 9H JH AH    >    2H 5H 9H TH AH
Full house    7H 7D JC JD JS    >    JH JD 7C 7D 7S
Four of a kind    7H JH JC JD JS    >    6H JH JC JD JS
Straight flush    9H TH JH QH KH    >    8H 9H TH JH QH
    (AS 2S 3S 4S 5S is also Straight flush)
Comparison method
Input:    two 5-card “hands”
Output:    1 - first hand is better
    0 - hands are equal
    -1 - second hand is better
Simulation output example
--- Round 0 ---
Player A hand:    AD KD
Player B hand:    AC TD
Player C hand:    QD QC

Table on flop:    2D 5C 7D
Table on turn:    2D 5C 7D QH
Table on river:    2D 5C 7D QH 4D

Player A win:    2D 4D 7D KD AD (flush)
